                It is not possible to find any sequencing primers for this
                sequence.  This is probably due to a long continguous A/T rich
                stretch of bases for which it is not possible to find primers
                suitable for sequencing from.

                  your sequence does not contain forward and reverse universal

                  It may additionally be because your sequence is too short.
